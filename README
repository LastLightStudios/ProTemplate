The Dragon has a few new mechanics including:
Sparks + Breaths: These are special cards that transform between the their Spark and Breath form.
Sparks are 0 cost cards that deal minor damage and generate Ember. When upgraded, they draw a card.
At 5 Ember, ALL Sparks transform into their Breath Form.
Breaths are 2 cost cards that deal lots of (AoE) damage, consuming Ember to increase the damage. ALL Breaths will revert to Sparks after the Ember is consumed.
Pride: At the end of her turn if any enemy intends to attack, the Dragon gain Block based on her Pride, and then loses half.
Hoard: This Exhausts a card and generates Pride.
Gems: Varied 0 cost Tokens that can be generated and Hoard on play.
Nests: A special power that grants an effect when the Dragon has remaining Energy at the end of her turn.
Shed: Reduces all debuff durations by 1 turn.


OVERVIEW:

The Dragon is a fearsome threat with lots of large AoE attacks. Many of her cards are higher cost, so she uses Pride, Gems, and Nests to make up for her
sometimes inefficient energy usage. She can generate energy, but not without a cost, potentially debuffing herself. However, she also has the ability to Shed
and reduce those debuffs. She also has various cards that encourage her to collect and expand her Deck.

This is a Spreadsheet of the cards, and is generally up to date. It may occasionally be ahead of the latest available release, but generally should be accurate.
